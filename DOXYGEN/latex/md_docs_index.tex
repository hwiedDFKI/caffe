\section*{Caffe}

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind. It is developed by Berkeley AI Research (\href{http://bair.berkeley.edu}{\tt B\+A\+IR}) and by community contributors. \href{http://daggerfs.com}{\tt Yangqing Jia} created the project during his PhD at UC Berkeley. Caffe is released under the \href{https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/LICENSE}{\tt B\+SD 2-\/\+Clause license}.

\subsection*{Why Caffe?}

{\bfseries Expressive architecture} encourages application and innovation. Models and optimization are defined by configuration without hard-\/coding. Switch between C\+PU and G\+PU by setting a single flag to train on a G\+PU machine then deploy to commodity clusters or mobile devices.

{\bfseries Extensible code} fosters active development. In Caffe\textquotesingle{}s first year, it has been forked by over 1,000 developers and had many significant changes contributed back. Thanks to these contributors the framework tracks the state-\/of-\/the-\/art in both code and models.

{\bfseries Speed} makes Caffe perfect for research experiments and industry deployment. Caffe can process {\bfseries over 60M images per day} with a single N\+V\+I\+D\+IA K40 G\+P\+U$\ast$. That\textquotesingle{}s 1 ms/image for inference and 4 ms/image for learning and more recent library versions and hardware are faster still. We believe that Caffe is among the fastest convnet implementations available.

{\bfseries Community}\+: Caffe already powers academic research projects, startup prototypes, and even large-\/scale industrial applications in vision, speech, and multimedia.
