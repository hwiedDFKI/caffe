This model is a replication of the model described in the \href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842}{\tt Google\+Net} publication. We would like to thank Christian Szegedy for all his help in the replication of Google\+Net model.

Differences\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item not training with the relighting data-\/augmentation;
\item not training with the scale or aspect-\/ratio data-\/augmentation;
\item uses \char`\"{}xavier\char`\"{} to initialize the weights instead of \char`\"{}gaussian\char`\"{};
\item quick\+\_\+solver.\+prototxt uses a different learning rate decay policy than the original solver.\+prototxt, that allows a much faster training (60 epochs vs 250 epochs);
\end{DoxyItemize}

The bundled model is the iteration 2,400,000 snapshot (60 epochs) using quick\+\_\+solver.\+prototxt

This bundled model obtains a top-\/1 accuracy 68.\+7\% (31.\+3\% error) and a top-\/5 accuracy 88.\+9\% (11.\+1\% error) on the validation set, using just the center crop. (Using the average of 10 crops, (4 + 1 center) $\ast$ 2 mirror, should obtain a bit higher accuracy.)

Timings for bvlc\+\_\+googlenet with cu\+D\+NN using batch\+\_\+size\+:128 on a K40c\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Average Forward pass\+: 562.\+841 ms.
\item Average Backward pass\+: 1123.\+84 ms.
\item Average Forward-\/\+Backward\+: 1688.\+8 ms.
\end{DoxyItemize}
