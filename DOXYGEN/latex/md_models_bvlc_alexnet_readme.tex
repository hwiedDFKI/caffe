This model is a replication of the model described in the \href{http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks}{\tt Alex\+Net} publication.

Differences\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item not training with the relighting data-\/augmentation;
\item initializing non-\/zero biases to 0.\+1 instead of 1 (found necessary for training, as initialization to 1 gave flat loss).
\end{DoxyItemize}

The bundled model is the iteration 360,000 snapshot. The best validation performance during training was iteration 358,000 with validation accuracy 57.\+258\% and loss 1.\+83948. This model obtains a top-\/1 accuracy 57.\+1\% and a top-\/5 accuracy 80.\+2\% on the validation set, using just the center crop. (Using the average of 10 crops, (4 + 1 center) $\ast$ 2 mirror, should obtain a bit higher accuracy.)

This model was trained by Evan Shelhamer
