\section*{Caffeinated Convolution}

The Caffe strategy for convolution is to reduce the problem to matrix-\/matrix multiplication. This linear algebra computation is highly-\/tuned in B\+L\+AS libraries and efficiently computed on G\+PU devices.

As it turns out, this same reduction was independently explored in the context of conv. nets by
