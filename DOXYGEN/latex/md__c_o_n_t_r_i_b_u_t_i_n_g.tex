\subsection*{Issues}

Specific Caffe design and development issues, bugs, and feature requests are maintained by Git\+Hub Issues.

{\itshape Please do not post usage, installation, or modeling questions, or other requests for help to Issues.} Use the \href{https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/caffe-users}{\tt caffe-\/users list} instead. This helps developers maintain a clear, uncluttered, and efficient view of the state of Caffe.

When reporting a bug, it\textquotesingle{}s most helpful to provide the following information, where applicable\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item What steps reproduce the bug?
\item Can you reproduce the bug using the latest \href{https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/master}{\tt master}, compiled with the {\ttfamily D\+E\+B\+UG} make option?
\item What hardware and operating system/distribution are you running?
\item If the bug is a crash, provide the backtrace (usually printed by Caffe; always obtainable with {\ttfamily gdb}).
\end{DoxyItemize}

Try to give your issue a title that is succinct and specific. The devs will rename issues as needed to keep track of them.

\subsection*{Pull Requests}

Caffe welcomes all contributions.

See the \href{http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/development.html}{\tt contributing guide} for details.

Briefly\+: read commit by commit, a PR should tell a clean, compelling story of {\itshape one} improvement to Caffe. In particular\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A PR should do one clear thing that obviously improves Caffe, and nothing more. Making many smaller P\+Rs is better than making one large PR; review effort is superlinear in the amount of code involved.
\item Similarly, each commit should be a small, atomic change representing one step in development. P\+Rs should be made of many commits where appropriate.
\item Please do rewrite PR history to be clean rather than chronological. Within-\/\+PR bugfixes, style cleanups, reversions, etc. should be squashed and should not appear in merged PR history.
\item Anything nonobvious from the code should be explained in comments, commit messages, or the PR description, as appropriate.
